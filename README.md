# IPDev-Prototyping
IPDev Prototyping code repositories for all prototyping/experimenting stages throughout the process of developing my project for Interactive Project Development module (871P4).

This repo documents any code from my prototyping stages in the inital development/experimentation of my preliminary project concept 'Network Loops' (working title), an interactive sound installation exploring the social interaction and interconnectivty of locative media and its predominant forms of interactivity and media devices.
